# Documentation

## Requirements

Building the documentation requires a few more packages that can be installed by running:

```shell
pip install .[docs]
```

from the package root directory.

## Making the documentation

Documentation can be generated by executing

``` shell
make html
```

from the **current** folder. This will produce a directory containing an html-formatted documentation "readthedocs-style". This doc can be browsed by opening `docs/build_/html/index.html`.

Other formats are available for export (e.g., pdf, man, texinfo); for more info, execute

``` shell
make help
```

from the `docs/` folder as well.

Documentation is generated based on the `.rst` files contained inside `docs/source`. If needed, these files can be automatically generated using `sphinx`: from the `docs/` repository, execute

``` shell
sphinx-apidoc -fP -o source/ ../sf_datalake
```
